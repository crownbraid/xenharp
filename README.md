# objective
to synthesize a microtuned diatonic pedal harp.

current functionality:
  1. can specify tuning of diatonic scale by setting a scale - as defined in *tuning_systems.js* - and a concert pitch.
  2. can microshift each string by 10 intervals. the current default 1/6 of a 12EDO semitone.
  
UI should entail an image of a harp without strings or pedals, with animated strings and pedals superimposed.

## technologies:
jQuery, Tone.js
