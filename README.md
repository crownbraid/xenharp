## XENHARP: microtuned diatonic pedal harp synthesizer

### Current Functionality
Diatonic scale is tuned (in *harp_states.js*) by defining a tuning system (from *tuning_systems.js*) and a concert pitch. The pedals microshift each pitch class by 12 intervals (current scale: 31-EDO A-440 / pedal-intervals: 1/72 of octave).
  
### Future Plans
 - dropdown menu for selecting tuning system
 - input field for defining concert pitch
 - pedal modulation should be scale specific
 - UI should entail a photograph of a harp without strings or pedals, with animated strings and pedals superimposed.

### technologies:
jQuery, Tone.js
