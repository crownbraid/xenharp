## XENHARP: microtuned diatonic pedal harp synthesizer

### Current Functionality
Diatonic scale is tuned (in *harp_states.js*) by defining a tuning system (from *tuning_systems.js*) and a concert pitch. The pedals microshift each pitch class by 12 micro-steps. 

*TEMP DEFAULT: 31-EDO A-440 & pedal-shifts of 1/6 12EDO semitone.*
  
### Future Plans
 - UI entails a photograph of a harp without strings or pedals, with animated strings and pedals superimposed.
 - dropdown menu for selecting tuning system
 - input field for defining concert pitch
 - pedal modulation should be scale specific
 
### technologies:
jQuery, Tone.js
